    <p class="intro">The co-founder of Kolamba in London’s Soho shares this recipe with us from the restaurant's kitchen. A lentil curry spiced with mustard seeds, chilli powder, curry leaves and cinnamon, with layers of delicate flavour.</p>
    <p class="intro">Try this lentil curry recipe from Sri Lankan-born chef Eroshan Meewella. Eroshan says, "We make our Parippu (dahl) with red split lentils cooked in coconut milk with a range of spices and curry leaves – a good dahl is a life-changing experience. So easy to make but so difficult to get right."</p>
    <p class="intro">This is a recipe that Eroshan shared as part of his guide to Sri Lankan cuisine. Check it out to learn about vegetable curries, string hoppers, milk toffee and more.</p>
    <p class="intro">Eroshan and Aushi Meewella, co-founders of Kolamba in Soho, raided the recipe books of friends and family members back in Colombo (Kolamba), where they grew up, for their restaurant. Their dishes are a mixture of multi-cultural recipes from Sinhalese, Tamil, Moor, Dutch and Malay influences, just as you’d find on the island itself.</p>

        <li>1 tsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>½ tsp black mustard seeds</li>

        <li>6-8 curry leaves, fresh, frozen or dried</li>
        <li>½ tsp hot chilli powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp (or you can use 1 tsp ground coriander powder and ½ tsp ground cumin) Sri Lankan curry powder</li>
        <li>¼ tsp ground turmeric</li>
        <li>5cm cinnamon stick</li>
        <li>125ml coconut milk</li>
        <li>fried onions, fried garlic, fried curry leaves and fried chillies, to garnish</li>

    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Add the drained lentils to the pan with 250ml of water, partially cover the pan and cook for 10 minutes. Add the coconut milk and ¾ tsp of fine sea salt, and simmer for 12-15 minutes or until the lentils are cooked and tender. Taste and adjust the seasoning if needed.</p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>Finish the lentils with fried onions, garlic, curry leaves and chillies, if you like.</p>
