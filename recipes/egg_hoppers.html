    <p class="intro">This dish is eaten throughout Sri Lanka. The sought-after result is one where the sides are crisp and the centre is aerated and soft – and the best breakfast hopper is made by cracking an egg into the centre just before steaming. Hoppers are traditionally made in a special pan which is essentially a small bowl-bottomed wok with handles. Alternatively, use a small non-stick frying pan.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>400ml coconut cream</li>
        <li>20g fresh yeast, or fast-action dried yeast 7g</li>
        <li>1 tbsp caster sugar</li>
        <li>500g rice flour</li>
        <li>3 egg whites</li>
        <li>for the pan vegetable oil</li>
        <li>to serve (optional) eggs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Stir the coconut cream, yeast and sugar in a bowl and leave in a warm spot for 45 minutes or until risen and frothy.</p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Sift the rice flour into the mixture and whisk until a smooth batter forms. Cover the bowl and leave in a warm place for 3-4 hours or until the batter has doubled in size – the rising time will vary considerably depending on the room temperature (the warmer, the better). Just before cooking, lightly beat the egg whites with a fork until they are foamy, then stir into the hopper mixture with 1 tsp of salt.</p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>Heat a hopper pan or a small non-stick frying pan over a high heat, wipe the pan lightly with oil, then pour in a 60ml ladleful of the mixture. Swirl to coat the sides of the pan, leaving a small pool of mixture in the centre. Crack in an egg (if using), then cover the pan with a lid and steam the hopper for 2-3 minutes or until the centre is firm and the sides are golden and crisp. Keep the cooked hoppers warm and repeat the process until all the batter has been used.</p>
